## Overview

This application allows users to search for real-time weather data of any city or town in the world.
The search results include the real-time temperature, the expected temperature range for the day, and the relative air humidity (as a percentage), as well as a small icon to represent the overall current weather data.
After every search, the user is allowed to search a different city and get a completely different result.
